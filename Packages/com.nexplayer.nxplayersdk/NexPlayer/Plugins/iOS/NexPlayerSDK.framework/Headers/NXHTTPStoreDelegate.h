/** 
 * \brief  This protocol defines a delegate protocol for the HLS offline storage feature in NexPlayer&trade;.
 * 
 * Any application that will handle HLS offline storage must implement this protocol.
 * 
 * In order to store content for offline playback:
 *     -# NXPlayer should set a desired bitrate using the \c setVideoBitrates:len:withOption.
 *     -# The \c NXHTTPStoreDelegate should be implemented.  The \c HTTPStore:url:storeOffset:receivedLength:storeBuffer:retrievedSize: method 
 *        will be called when HLS contents need to be stored.
 *     -# The player should be opened with a call to \c mode:NXOpenModeStoreStream.
 *     -# Then the player should be started with a call to \c nexPlayer:completedAsyncCmdOpenWithResult:playbackType: from the NXPlayer delegate.
 *     -# After contents are stored, \c stop: should be called once the event \c nexPlayerDidReachEndOFContent is received by \c NXPlayerDelegate.
 * 
 * Once content is stored for offline playback, an application can implement \c NXHTTPRetrieveDelegate to retrieve the stored
 * HLS content and play it back.
 * 
 * \see NXHTTPRetrieveDelegate
 * \since version 5.24
