 *
 * When assigned to NXPlayer::DRMDescrambler, an object that adopts this protocol
 * will be called for each frame of audio or video data before that frame is 
 * decoded.  This provides a general opportunity for descrambling the frame.  
 * For types of DRM where descrambling must occur at a different point in the 
 * playback process or where additional information is needed, more specific
 * descrambling protocols are provided, and should be used instead of this one 
 * where necessary.
 *
 * This protocol comprises only one method, which is called to perform the
 * descrambling.

 *
 * \param[in]  type                 The type of frame to be descrambled:
 *                                      - <b>NXDRMDataTypeVideo (0):</b> Video
 *                                      - <b>NXDRMDataTypeAudio (1):</b> Audio
 *
 * \param[in]  pInputBuffer         The encrypted data to be descrambled
 *
 * \param[in]  uiInputBufferSize    The size of the encrypted data, in bytes
 *
 * \param[out] pOutputBuffer        The location at which to place the descrambled 
 *                                  output data.  This may point to the same
 *                                  location as the input buffer, or it may point
 *                                  to a separate location. The size available for
 *                                  the output buffer is the same as the size of
 *                                  the input buffer.  That is, the decrypted data
 *                                  may be smaller than the encrypted data, but
 *                                  not larger.
 *
 * \param[out] puiOutputBufferSize  The size of the decrypted data.  The callback
 *                                  must set this value.  This may be equal to or
 *                                  smaller than \c uiInputBufferSize, but not larger.
 *
 * \returns                         The method should return zero if the data
 *                                  was successfully descrambled.  In the case of
 *                                  an error, it should return -1.
