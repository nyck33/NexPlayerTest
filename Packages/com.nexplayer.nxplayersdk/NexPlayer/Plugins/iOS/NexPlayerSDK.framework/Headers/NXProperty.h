/** \defgroup prop Properties
 *
 * There are a wide array of properties that can be adjusted to control the
 * behavior of various aspects of the player, from buffer time (how many seconds
 * of streaming content are buffered before playback begins) to the behavior
 * of the player under various error conditions (whether or not to allow
 * audio-only playback if an unsupported video codec is detected, for example).
 *
 * Properties can be set and retrieved through:
 *
 * - NXPlayer::setProperty:toValue: 
 * - NXPlayer::getProperty:value:
 * - NXPlayer::getProperty:
 *
 * Properties are identified with an integer identifier from the NXProperty
 * enumeration.
 * 
 * The value of each property is an unsigned integer.  For some properties, 
 * it may be necessary to cast this to a different type.  See the individual 
 * property documentation for details.  If no type is specified, it is safe
 * to treat the property as an unsigned integer.
 * 
 * \note Members of the enumeration that have not been documented, as
 *       well as values that have not yet been used, are subject to change in future
 * versions.  Do not access or change undocumented properties, or your code
 * may behave unpredictably and may break in future versions.
