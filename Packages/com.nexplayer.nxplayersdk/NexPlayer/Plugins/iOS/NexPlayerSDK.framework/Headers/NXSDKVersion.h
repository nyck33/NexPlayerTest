 * \brief A singleton class containing version information

 * \code

 * \endcode
 * 
 * Attempts to call \c alloc on this class or \c init on instances of it
 * will fail.
 *

 *
 * \code
 NXSDKVersion *version = [NXSDKVersion sharedInstance];
 NSString *buildTimeAndVersion =
	[NSString stringWithFormat: @"%@ %@ %@ %@", 
		version.versionString,
		version.buildDate,
