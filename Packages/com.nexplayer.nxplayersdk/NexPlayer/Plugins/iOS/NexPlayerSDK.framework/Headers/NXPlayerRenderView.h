/**
 * \brief Provides a view in which NexPlayer&trade;&nbsp;video output can be
 *			displayed, creates an associated NXPlayer object, and
 *			binds it to the view.
 * 
 * This is similar to NXPlayerView, except that NXPlayerView scales the
 * video to maintain the aspect ratio, and handles resizing and rotation,
 * whereas NXPlayerRenderView simply stretches the video to fill the view.
 *
 * This is the recommended way to render video with NexPlayer&trade;&nbsp;if you
 * wish to calculate scaling values yourself.
 *
 * The layer associated with this class is a CAEAGLLayer, suitable for use
 * with NXPlayer.  Each NXPlayerLayer creates and manages an associated
 * NXPlayer object, including assigning the view's layer to the \c renderLayer
 * of the player, and updating the NXPlayer video render buffers if
 * the size of the view changes.
 *
 * This provides all of the usual UIView methods and properties.
 *
 * In addition, you can use the NXPlayerRenderView::player property to access the
 * NXPlayer object and control the player.  For example, to play a local
 * video file named "test.wmv" in a NXPlayerRenderView, you could simply write:
 *
 * \code
 [hPlayerView.player openAndPlayFromBundle: @"test.wmv"];
 * \endcode
