@protocol NXDeceUVDescrambler


/**
 * \brief   Called by the player when there is DECE Ultra Violet data available for
 *          descrambling.
 *
 * Note that the descramble method will be called for all data of
 * the requested type (specified by NXDRMType)
 * even if the data is not encrypted.  This is because the player has
 * no way to determine if the data is cleartext or encrypted.  This
 * method must make that determination separately.
 *
 * \param player                    The NXPlayer instance that this descrambler
 *                                  has been assigned to.
 * \param[in] pInputBuffer          The original (possibly scrambled) input data.
 * \param[in] uiInputBufferSize     The size (in bytes) of the input buffer.
 * \param[out] pOutputBuffer        The location at which to write the descrambled
 *                                  output data. Note that this may overlap or
 *                                  be the same as the input buffer location.
 * \param[out] puiOutputBufferSize  The size of the descrambled data.  The callback
 *                                  must set this value.  This may be equal to or
 *                                  smaller than \c uiInputBufferSize, but not larger.
 * \param[in] pSampleEncBox         The \c SampleEncryptionBox, as detailed in <em>[UV] Ultra Violet Protocol Specification</em>.
 * \param[in] dwSampleEncBoxLen     The length, in bytes, of the data in \c pSampleEncBox.
 * \param[in] dwSampleIDX           The index of the media object (frame or sample, depending on the media format) being descrambled. 
 * \param[in] dwTrackID             The Media Track ID, from \c TfhdBox, as defined in <em>[UV] Ultra Violet Protocol Specification</em>.
 * 
 * \return                          0 if successful, -1 if there was an error.
 * 
 * \since 5.16
