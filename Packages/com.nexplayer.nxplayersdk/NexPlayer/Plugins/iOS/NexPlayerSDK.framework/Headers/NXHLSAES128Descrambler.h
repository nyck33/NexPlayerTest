/**
 * \brief   Called every time an AES128 encrypted HLS content is received.
 *
 * \param[in]  player               The calling NXPlayer instance.
 * \param[in]  pInBuf               The encrypted data to be descrambled.
 *
 * \param[in]  dwInBufSize          The size of the encrypted data, in \c bytes.
 *
 * \param[out] pOutBuf              The location at which to place the decrypted
 *                                  output data.  This may point to the same
 *                                  location as the input buffer, or it may point
 *                                  to a separate location. The size available for
 *                                  the output buffer is the same as the size of
 *                                  the input buffer. That is, the decrypted data
 *                                  may be smaller than the encrypted data, but
 *                                  not larger.
 *
 * \param[out] pdwOutBufSize        The size of the decrypted data.  The callback
 *                                  must set this value.  This may be equal to or
 *                                  smaller than \c dwInBufSize, but not larger.
 *
 * \param[in]  pSegmentUrl		    A pointer to the URL of the segment of content.
 * \param[in]  pMpdUrl			    A pointer to the original URL of the content playlist.
 * \param[in]  pKeyAttr			    A pointer to the decryption Key information.
 * \param[in]  dwSegmentSeq		    The sequence number of the TS segment file.
 * \param[in]  pKey				    A pointer to the decryption Key.  This parameter is only meaningful when \c dwKeySize is greater than 0 (i.e. a key has been downloaded).
 * \param  dwKeySize			    The size of the decryption Key.  This parameter will be zero if no key has been downloaded.
 *
 * \returns  1 if successful; 0 if there was an error.
 *
 * \see NXPlayer::hlsAESDescrambler
