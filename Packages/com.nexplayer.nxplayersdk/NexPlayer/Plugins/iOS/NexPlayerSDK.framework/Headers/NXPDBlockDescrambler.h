 * \brief   The \c NXPDBlockDescrambler protocol must be adopted and implemented

 *          data received during progressive download and playback.
 *
 *
 * Any object can adopt this protocol, but it is typically adopted by either
 * the NXPlayerDelegate, or by a dedicated DRM descrambling object.
 *
 * When assigned to NXPlayer::PDBlockDescrambler, an object that adopts this protocol
 * will be called for each block of a file received via progressive download.
 *
 * This protocol comprises only one method, which is called to perform the
 * descrambling.
