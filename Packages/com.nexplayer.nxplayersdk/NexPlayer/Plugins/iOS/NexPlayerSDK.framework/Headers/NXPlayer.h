 * \endcode
 *
 * Each track has a variety of additional data associated with it, including a
 * track name, language, and dictionary of metadata.  It is important to note
 * that track name and language are not available for all subtitle formats; in
 * some cases, the track number (as an index in the \c subtitleTracks array) is
 * the only identification available, especially for formats that only support
 * one track.
 *
 * For SMI subtitle files, the SMI class name is provided in the metadata for
 * each track.
 *
 * The default behavior, if an NXSubtitleTrack is displayed as a string
 * (using \code [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@", subtitleTrack] \endcode) is
 * to display the name, and if the name is not available, the language.  If
 * neither are available, the SMI class name is used.  If none of those are
 * available "Subtitle Track N" is used, where N is the 1-based index of the
 * track.
 *
 * Since SMI class names may be purely arbitrary, the best approach for an SMI
 * file is to read the file itself and parse the header to determine the actual
 * language information for each class name.
 *
 * However, if this is not an option, another method is to heuristically check
 * the string.  Many SMI files follow an ad-hoc standard of naming classes
 * using the format:
 *
 * - \c (language)(country)(type)
 * 
 * where each of these fields is a two-character uppercase code, and country
 * may be omitted.  For example:
 * 
 * - \c ENUSCC English, United State, Closed Caption
 * - \c KRCC Korean, Closed Caption
 * - \c FRFRCC French, France, Closed Caption
 *
 * Therefore, it is possible to check if the language string is a 4- or 6-letter
 * uppercase code, and if so, to parse it for language and country.  The language
 * generally an ISO 639 short (two-character) language code, and the country is
 * generally an ISO 3166-1 two-character country code.
 *
 * Since the exact heuristics that will be suitable for a given application
 * depend on the needs of the application, NexPlayer&trade;&nbsp;simply provides the
 * raw language string and does not attempt to interpret it in any way.
 *
 * If a given string is not recognized by the application, it is generally best
 * to fall back to displaying the raw string.

 * \brief  This method is used to change the playback rate.
 *
 * \note  Speed Control is an optional feature.
 * This method makes it possible to allow users to adjust the playback rate, from 0.1 of the original speed to 4x speed, by changing the value of the parameter \c playRate.
 * For example, to play content at half-speed, \c playRate should be set to 0.5
 *
 * This method doesn't work if it is called when NexPlayer&trade;&nbsp;is stopped.
 *
 * \param playRate
 *            This float represents the rate by which to change the playback rate.
 *            It must be in the range of 0.1 to 4.0, which adjusts the playback speed from 0.1x to 4x the original speed of the content with HW decoder.
 *            It must be in the range of 0.1 to 2.0, which adjusts the playback speed from 0.1x to 2x the original speed of the content with SW decoder.
 * 			  It must be in the range of 0.5 to 2.0, when you use AirPlay mode. (isAirPlayActive is YES)
 *
 * \warning  When using this method with HLS or Smooth Streaming content, playing multitrack content may cause unstable performance.
 *           Therefore, playing content as a single track is encouraged.
 *			 When using this method with Live content, beffering may occur more frequently.
