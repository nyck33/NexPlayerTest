 * \param[in] pInputBuffer          The original (possibly scrambled) input data.
 * \param[in] uiInputBufferSize     The size (in bytes) of the input buffer.
 * \param[out] pOutputBuffer        The location at which to write the descrambled

 *                                  be the same as the input buffer location.
 * \param[out] puiOutputBufferSize  The size of the descrambled data.  The callback
 *                                  must set this value.  This may be equal to or

 * \param[in] pIVBuffer             The initial vector.
 * \param[in] dwIVBufferSize        The size (in bytes) of the initial vector
 * \return                          0 if successful, -1 if there was an error
