/**
 * \brief Delegate protocol for NXPlayer.
 * 
 * Any class that will receive events from a NXPlayer instance as a
 * delegate should implement this protocol.
 *
 * All methods are optional; implement the methods for events which
 * you wish the delegate to handle.
 *
 * NXPlayerDelegate::nexPlayer:willBeSentEvent:withArgs: is a special
 * method that can be used to trap all events, and which can filter events
 * before they are passed to other event handling methods.
 *
 * Use specific event handling methods if you need to respond to a specific
 * event.  For example, if you wish to issue a \c play command when the
 * content has been successfully opened, you might implement
 * NXPlayerDelegate::nexPlayer:completedAsyncCmdOpenWithResult:playbackType:
 * as follows:
 * \code
	- (void) nexPlayer:(NXPlayer *)nxplayer completedAsyncCmdOpenWithResult:(NXError)result playbackType:(NXPlaybackType)type {
		[m_playerView.player start];
	}
 * \endcode
 *
 * Use the general event handling method if you need to respond to a large
 * group of events (or all events) in an identical way.  For example,
 * if you wish to note every event that occurs in the log, you might
 * implement NXPlayerDelegate::nexPlayer:willBeSentEvent:withArgs:.
 * \code
	- (BOOL) nexPlayer:(NXPlayer *)nxplayer willBeSentEvent:(NSString *)selectorName withArgs:(NSArray *)args {
		NSArray *el = [selectorName componentsSeparatedByString:@":"];
		NSMutableString* output = [NSMutableString string];
		for( int i=0; i<[el count]; i++ ) {
			if( [[el objectAtIndex:i] length] < 1 )
				continue;
			if( i>=[args count] )
				[output appendFormat:@"%@:? ", [el objectAtIndex:i], nil ];
			else
				[output appendFormat:@"%@:%@ ", [el objectAtIndex:i], [args objectAtIndex:i], nil ];
		}
		NSLog(@"NEXPLAYER EVENT: %@\n", output);
		return YES;
	}
 * \endcode

/**
 * \brief	Subtitle (caption) text has changed, and the application should 
 *			update the display with the new text.
 *
 * NexPlayer&trade;&nbsp;handles the parsing, decoding and timing of subtitle text,
 * but not the display of that text. When subtitle text is ready for display,
 * this method is called, and the delegate must display the text in an
 * appropriate manner.  Often, this is simply done by setting the text attribute
 * of a UITextView that is positioned on top of the video.
 *
 * For local subtitles, the subtitle text from multiple tracks may be combined
 * in a single string in the \c subtitleText and \c subtitleBytes parameters,
 * depending on the setting of NXPlayer::captionLanguages.
 *
 * There are multiple sources for subtitles.  For example, subtitles may come
 * from a local subtitle file (such as SMI, SUB, or SRT file) specified when
 * the content was opened, or they may be included as part of the data streamed
 * from the server.  When the delegate is called, the \c source parameter 
 * identifies the source of the subtitle text.  This text replaces any previous
 * text from the same source.  Most applications only play subtitles from a
 * single source, so this parameter can usually be ignored.  The source may be
 * any string, but in the current version of the SDK it will always be one of:
 *  - LOCAL
 *  - STREAM
 *
 * To handle subtitles from an arbitrary number of sources simultaneously,
 * use the \c source value as a dictionary key and keep a dictionary of the
 * current subtitles for each source.  Then concatenate these when updating
 * the display.
 *
 * \par     <b>A note about Encoding</b>
 *          Many subtitle formats do not actually specify an encoding
 *          for the subtitle text.  NexPlayer&trade;&nbsp;uses a heuristic
 *			algorithm to attempt to determine the encoding.  
 * \par
 *          Since it is not possible to make an absolutely certain determination about the
 *			encoding in use automatically, alternative algorithms may be better
 *			suited to some applications, or there may be applications where it
 *			is desirable to let the user select the encoding.
 * \par
 *			For these reasons, in addition to a text string (decoded using the
 *          detected encoding), NexPlayer&trade;&nbsp;also provides the raw bytes
 *			prior to decoding, so the application may handle them differently
 *			if necessary.
 * \par
 *          Currently, the following encodings are detected automatically:
 *			- ASCII (low ASCII only)
 *			- UTF-8 (Unicode)
 *			- EUC-KR (Korean)
 *			- EUC-JP (Japanese)
 * 
 * \param[in] nxplayer		The NXPlayer instance that generated the event.
 * \param[in] subtitleText  The string as decoded using the detected encoding.
 * \param[in] subtitleBytes The original bytes of the string prior to decoding.
 * \param[in] source        The source of the subtitles.  See above.
