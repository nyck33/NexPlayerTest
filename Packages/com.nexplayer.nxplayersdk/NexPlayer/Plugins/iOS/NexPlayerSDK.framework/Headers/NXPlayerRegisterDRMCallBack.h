	 * \ingroup cbtypes
	 * \brief   Callback function for descrambling HLS-TS encrypted content (HTTP
	 *          Live Streaming content encrypted at the segment level).
	 *
	 * This callback is called every time an HLS segment is received.  The segment
	 * may be either a TS file or an audio file.  The player does not attempt to
	 * detect whether or not a segment is encrypted, but rather passes all segments
	 * directly to the callback, if one is registered.
	 *
	 * \param[in]  pInputBuffer         The segment (TS file or audio file) that
	 *                                  has been received.
	 *
	 * \param[in]  uiInputBufferSize    The size of the data at pInputBuffer, in \c bytes.
	 *
	 * \param[out] pOutputBuffer        The location at which to place the descrambled
	 *                                  output data.  This may point to the same
	 *                                  location as the input buffer, or it may point
	 *                                  to a separate location. The size available for
	 *                                  the output buffer is the same as the size of
	 *                                  the input buffer.  That is, the decrypted data
	 *                                  may be smaller than the encrypted data, but
	 *                                  not larger.
	 *
	 * \param[out] puiOutputBufferSize  The size of the decrypted data.  The callback
	 *                                  must set this value.  This may be equal to or
	 *                                  smaller than \c uiInputBufferSize, but not larger.
	 *
	 * \param[in]  pMediaFileURL        The URL of the segment media file (TS file or
	 *                                  audio file).
	 *
	 * \param[in]  pPlaylistURL         The URL of the immediate parent playlist (the
	 *                                  playlist directly referecing the media file).
	 *
	 * \param[in]  pUserData            The user data passed when the callback was
	 *                                  originally registered.
	 *
	 * \returns                         The callback should return zero if the data
	 *                                  was successfully descrambled.  In the case of
	 *                                  an error, it should return -1.
