/**
 * \brief   Information about a media stream
 *
 * For some local formats, and some streaming formats, multiple alternate
 * media streams may be available.  For example, audio may be available in
 * multiple languages.
 *
 * Media streams are described by NXMediaStreamInfo objects.  The list of
 * streams available can be found in NXContentInfo::streams, and the currently
 * selected audio and video streams can be found in NXContentInfo::currentVideoStream
 * and NXContentInfo::currentAudioStream, respectively.
 *
 * Streams may contain multiple tracking comprising the same media encoded at different
 * quality levels. This allows the player to automatically switch between tracks
 * based on the quality of the network connection and the available bandwidth.
 *
 * The full list of tracks available for a stream is in the array
 * NXMediaStreamInfo::tracks; the current track that has been automatically
 * selected by the player is in NXMediaStreamInfo::currentTrack
 *
 * Some streaming formats support variations on the content (not merely the
 * encoding). Tracks that contain different content are marked with custom
 * attributes to distinguish them from tracks that are merely variations in
 * quality.
 *

 * However, since a given NXContentInfo object can only refer to one set of
