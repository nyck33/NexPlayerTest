/**
 * \brief  This class allows NXPlayer to handle SEI picture timing information in H.264 content.
 *
 * In summary, this class passes timing information about each video frame in H.264 content if the content provides
 * SEI picture timing information.  NXPlayer passes an instance of this class.
 *
 * In most cases, this information will include \c full_timestamp_flag, \c seconds_value, \c minutes_value, and \c hours_value.
 * But also note that \c seconds_value, \c minutes_value, and \c hours_value are valid <b>only</b> if \c full_timestamp_flag is 1.
 *
 * For more in depth information about SEI picture timing information, please see the H.264 specifications.
