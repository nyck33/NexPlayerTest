 * \brief   The \c NXManifestAndPlaylistDescrambler protocol must be adopted and implemented

 * Any object can adopt this protocol, but it is typically adopted by either
 * the NXPlayerDelegate, or by a dedicated descrambling object.
 *
 * When assigned to NXPlayer::manifestAndPlaylistDescrambler, an object that
 * adopts this protocol will be called whenever a top-level playlist or
 * manifest is obtained, and at that point can perform any descrambling

 * This protocol comprises only one method, which is called to perform the
 * descrambling.

/**

 * \param[in]       player          The calling NXPlayer instance.
 *
 * \param[in]       url             The URL from which this top-level playlist 
 *                                  or manifest was retrieved (in the case of
 *                                  redirection, this will be the URL before 
 *                                  redirection).
 *
 * \param[in,out]   pData           The contents of the playlist.  Descrambling 
 *                                  should be done in-place, so on input this is 
 *                                  the scrambled playlist, and on output it is 
 *                                  the descrambled playlist.
 *
 * \param[in,out]   pdwDataLen      On input, the size of the original (scrambled)
 *                                  playlist; on output, the size of the descrambled
 *                                  playlist.  Note that the output size must be 
 *                                  equal to or smaller than the input size.
 *
 * \returns                         The method should return zero if the data
 *                                  was successfully descrambled.  In the case of
 *                                  an error, it should return -1.
