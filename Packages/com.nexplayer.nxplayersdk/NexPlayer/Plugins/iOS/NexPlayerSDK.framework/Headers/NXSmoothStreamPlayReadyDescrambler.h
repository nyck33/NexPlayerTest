/**
 * \brief   Called by the player when there is data available for

 * This function is called every time a Smooth Streaming fragment is received,
 * regardless of whether or not the fragment is encrypted.  That must be
 * determined separately.
 *
 * \param player  The NXPlayer instance that this descrambler has been assigned to.
 * \param[in] pInputBuffer  	The original (possibly scrambled) input data.
 * \param uiInputBufferSize 	The size (in bytes) of the input buffer.
 * \param[out] pOutputBuffer	The location at which to write the descrambled output
 *								data.  Note that this may overlap or be the same as
 *								the input buffer location.
 * \param[out] puiOutputBufferSize
 *								The size of the descrambled data. The callback must
 *								set this value.  This may be equal to or smaller than
 *								\c uiInputBufferSize, but not larger.
 * \param[out] pSampleEncBox	The \c SampleEncryptionBox, as detailed in the <i>[MS-SSTR] Smooth
 *								Streaming Protocol Specification</i>.
 * \param dwSampleEncBoxLen		The length, in bytes, of the data at \c pSampleEncBox
 * \param dwSampleIDX			The index of the media object (frame or sample, depending on
 *								media format) being descrambled.
 * \param dwTrackID				Media Track ID, from \c TfhdBox, as defined in the <i>[MS-SSTR]
 *								Smooth Streaming Protocol Specification</i>.
