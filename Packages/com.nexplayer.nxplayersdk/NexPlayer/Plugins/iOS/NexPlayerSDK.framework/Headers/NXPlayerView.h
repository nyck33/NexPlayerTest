/**
 * \brief Provides a view in which NexPlayer&trade; video output can be
 *			displayed, and creates an associated NXPlayer object and
 *			binds it to the view.
 * 
 * This is the recommended way to render video with NexPlayer&trade;.
 *
 * Each NXPlayerView creates and manages an associated NXPlayer object, 
 * including assigning the view's layer to the \c renderLayer
 * of the player, and updating the NXPlayer video render buffers if
 * the size of the view changes.
 *
 * Each NXPlayerView also creates and maintains an NXPlayerRenderView
 * in which the actual player output is displayed.  The NXPlayerRenderView is
 * managed automatically to maintain the correct scaling.  In the case
 * of content with CEA 608 closed captions, if the captions are turned on,
 * the NXPlayerView also creates and maintains a NXCEA608CaptionView to
 * receive and display caption information as it is received.
 *
 * This provides all of the usual UIView methods and properties.
 *
 * In addition, you can use the NXPlayerView::player property to access the
 * NXPlayer object and control the player.  For example, to play a local
 * video file named "test.wmv" in an NXPlayerView, you could simply write:
 *
 * \code
 [hPlayerView.player openAndPlayFromBundle: @"test.wmv"];
 * \endcode

/**
 * \brief   Controls automatic scaling of the video image when

 *
 * Set this to any other legal value (listed below) to automatically rescale
 * the video whenever the view size changes.  The video is also rescaled to
 * the appropriate size as soon as this value is changed.
 *
 * Changes to the scale can be animated using the usual UIView animation
 * technqiues (begin and commit).

 * - <b>NXScale_None:</b>           The video size will not be changed; the size  
 *                                  and location can be set by assigning values

 *      
 * - <b>NXScale_FitInView:</b>      Fit video to container (as large as possible 
 *                                  without cropping).  The aspect ratio of the

 *                                  precisely match the aspect ratio of the view.
 *
 * - <b>NXScale_FillView:</b>       NexPlayer&trade;&nbsp;will fill the parent container.
 *                                  If the video dimensions don't match the view
 *                                  dimensions, the video will be cropped to
 *                                  avoid black bars.  The aspect ratio is
 *                                  maintained.
 *
 * - <b>NXScale_Stretch:</b>        Stretch the video to match the dimensions of
 *                                  the view (does not maintain the aspect ratio)
 *                                  of the original video.
