Please open the scene NexPlayerDLL, and you will see the following:

Here you can see NumTimesPause, LastPause and Empty Game Object
PauseResumeTracker.

Just a screenshot of the PlayPause button I reference in my script.

And another screenshot of the CurrentTime Game Object I reference in my
script.

My Unity version is 2020.3.34f1 on Windows.

I had to rebuild the DLL for x64 as I first built it for x86.
